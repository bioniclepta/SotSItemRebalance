# TODO

- DONE: Add LookingGlass support

- DONE: Remove reflect on antler shield. Transition to a movement speed item (if reflection, throw to red and up some stats?)
  - DONE: Add shield and movement speed
- DONE: Changed bison steak to slightly increase health and damage based on max health such to be a scaleable white item without making it busted enough to move to green
- DONE: Make these changes work with LookingGlass mod (checks if it is installed, then fixes item descriptions)
- DONE: Warped Echo transitions to a green, 5% chance on hit (+5% per item, maybe scaling logarithmically) to apply another stack of a debuff an enemy has
- DONE: Shatering justice now gives permanent curse effect, instead of decreasing armor, decreases max HP
- Make prayer beads auto scrap/break after a certain level, giving the buffs automatically
- Sonourous Whispers remove elite condition for dropping items, instead make it non TP bosses
  - This is a maybe change now, need to see how the nerfed version in the newest patch works
- Knockback fin knocks back instead of up for ground enemies, and down for flying enemies
- Sonourous Whispers remove elite condition for dropping items, instead make it non TP bosses
- Warped Echo transitions to void item, with some flair that makes it worth picking up (TBD)
- Knockback fin knocks back instead of up
- War bonds goes from red to green, giving a small chests worth of money at the start of the stage, and granting 5% (+5% for each item) more gold on kill
- Bolstering lantern grants more movement speed while below 50% health
- Unstable Transmitter explosion stuns for 5 seconds instead of teleporting and explosion radius is bigger (maybe scale radius with more items?)
- Sale Start seems strong. TBD on fix, but I'd like it to not spew 5 items out of every chest
- Squid polyp inherits the items recieved from the chest (if command then get random item from that tier)

# Thoughts

- Warped Echo transitions to void item, with some flair that makes it worth picking up (TBD)
- Either noxious thorns or shattering justice apply the malachite debuff (or a custom one that limits healing instead of removing it) for a short duration.
  - This would help deal with the healing elites and dunestriders early game
