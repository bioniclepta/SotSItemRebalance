# TODO

- DONE: Remove reflect on antler shield. Transition to a movement speed item (if reflection, throw to red and up some stats?)
  - Decide on how to set this apart. armor and movement speed is nice, so maybe keep, but just brainstorm idk
- Make prayer beads auto scrap/break after a certain level, giving the buffs automatically
- Sonourous Whispers remove elite condition for dropping items, instead make it non TP bosses
- Warped Echo transitions to void item, with some flair that makes it worth picking up (TBD)
- Knockback fin knocks back instead of up
- War bonds goes from red to green, giving a small chests worth of money at the start of the stage, and granting 5% (+5% for each item) more gold on kill
- Bolstering lantern grants more movement speed while below 50% health
- Unstable Transmitter explosion stuns for 5 seconds instead of teleporting and explosion radius is bigger (maybe scale radius with more items?)
- Sale Start seems strong. TBD on fix, but I'd like it to not spew 5 items out of every chest
- Shatering justice armor decrease goes from 60 -> 120 and slows enemy attack speed by 40%

- Make these changes work with LookingGlass mod (checks if it is installed, then fixes item descriptions)
